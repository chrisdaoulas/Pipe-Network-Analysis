This Jupyter Notebook showcases a data science project focused on analyzing water pipe infrastructure using geospatial datasets. As a data scientist, I developed this project to load and explore pipe and historical failure data from IPFS using GeoPandas, performing statistical analysis and sampling tasks. The notebook ensures self-contained execution with dynamic library imports (e.g., pandas, GeoPandas, scikit-learn) and adheres to coding best practices, including modular functions, consistent formatting, and clear documentation. Key tasks include data preprocessing, visualization, and sampling, demonstrating proficiency in handling large-scale geospatial data for infrastructure insights
